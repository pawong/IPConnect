## Notes

You can enable `Location Services` via the commandline to map your current location. I've found that this can cause memory to leak, however, it never leaks a huge amount.

1. Quit IP Connect. And or kill the process by double clicking on it in the activity monitor and choosing Quit.
2. Open a terminal.
3. At the prompt, type the following command:
    ```bash
    open -a /Applications/IP\ Connect.app/ --args -L:1
    ```
    Use 1 for enabling, 0 fr disabling.

Q: What is Mazookie?

A: Mazookie is a company that used to put apps on the MacOS App Store. This doesn't happen any more because Apple charges money to be a developer and there's no money in these apps, so the projects have been opensourced. Yeah, free stuff!
